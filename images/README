Strict naming conventions must be followed when adding files to the "images/" directory. See below:

1. Types (floor,wallup,hall,etc)
2. Theme (brick,stone,etc)
3. Names (repeat type + number: ie floor0) 
    # NOTE: assumes repeat type blocks under theme are chosen at random
4. Action (action + number: ie run0 or moveup0)
    # NOTE: 
         _ proceeding action means start with this(ie _initial)
           multiple _ mean choose one at random to use
    #       otherwise assumed action
    #       always loads "initial" action first
5. action_images:
    _ proceeding means stop animating after reaching that image
        NOTE: _ proceeding action means its static or not updated (ie _initial)
            multiple _ choose random one for start
    names: number.png  assumed displayed in numerical order
